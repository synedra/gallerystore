<details>
<summary><strong>1Ô∏è‚É£ Can I run this workshop on my computer?</strong></summary>
<p>There is nothing preventing you from running the workshop on your own machine. If you do so, you will need: <code>git</code>, <code>docker</code>, <code>docker-compose</code>.</p>
<p>In this readme, we try to provide instructions for local development as well - but keep in mind that the main focus is development on Gitpod, hence <strong>we can't guarantee live support</strong> about local development in order to keep on track with the schedule. However, we will do our best to give you the info you need to succeed.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>2Ô∏è‚É£ Are there other prerequisites?</strong></summary>
<p>You will need enough <em>real estate</em> on screen, we will ask you to open a few windows and it would not fit on mobiles (tablets should be OK).</p>
<p>You will need an Astra account: don't worry, we'll work through that in the following.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>3Ô∏è‚É£ Do I need to pay for anything for this workshop?</strong></summary>
<p><strong>No.</strong> All tools and services we provide here are FREE. FREE not only during the session but also afterwards.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong>4Ô∏è‚É£ Will I get a certificate if I attend this workshop?</strong></summary>
<p>Attending the session is not enough. You need to complete the <a href="#7-homework" target="_blank">homework detailed below</a><br />

<h2><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="4-create-your-astra-db-instance"> </a>4. Create your Astra DB instance</h2>
<p><em><strong><code>ASTRA DB</code></strong> is the simplest way to run Cassandra with zero operations at all - just push the button and get your cluster. No credit card required, 40M read/write operations and about 80GB storage monthly for free - sufficient to run small production workloads. If you end your credits the databases will pause, no charge</em></p>
<p>Leveraging the <a href="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-instance/#c-procedure" target="_blank">Database creation guide</a>, create a database. <em>Right-Click the following button</em> and <em>Open in a new TAB:</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>‚ÑπÔ∏è Note:</strong> If you already have a database <code>workshops</code>, simply add a keyspace <code>machine_learning</code> using the <code>Add Keyspace</code> button on the bottom right hand corner of the DB dashboard page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While the database is being created, you will also get a<br />
<a href="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/#b-prerequisites" target="_blank"><strong>Security token</strong></a>:<br />
save it somewhere safe, since you'll need it later during setup.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important</strong></p>
<pre><code>The instructor will show you on screen how to create a token 
but will have to destroy to token immediately for security reasons.
</code></pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The database status will change from <code>Pending</code> to <code>Active</code> when the database is ready, this will only take 2-3 minutes. You will also receive an email when it is ready.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you already had the database, you can still create a new token: see <a href="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/create-token/#b-prerequisites" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then go to the <em>Connect</em> tab for your database and download your <strong>Secure Connect Bundle</strong>, as described <a href="https://awesome-astra.github.io/docs/pages/astra/download-scb/" target="_blank">at this link</a>. It's a ZIP file of about 12Kb, which you will need later.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="5-setup"> </a>5. Setup</h2>
<p>We suggest to use Gitpod: <strong>right-click</strong> on the following button and <strong>open in new tab</strong>:</p>
<p><a href="https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-introduction-to-machine-learning" target="_blank"><img src="images/open_in_gitpod.svg?raw=true" /></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can also run everything locally. In this case, you may need to know what you are doing, as we won't be able to troubleshoot live.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you are on Gitpod, simply follow the on-screen instructions to get everything running:</p>
<ul>
<li>‚åõ <em>Wait 2-3 minutes as your IDE (and Linux box) gets provisioned...</em></li>
<li>When prompted in the Gitpod Console, enter the following information to connect to DB:
<ul>
<li>Astra DB Token ID</li>
<li>Astra DB Token Secret</li>
<li>Keyspace name (<code>machine_learning</code> by default)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When asked, drag-and-drop (or copy) the Secure bundle to the required destination</li>
<li>‚åõ <em>Wait another 1-2 minutes (while tables are created and populated in your database) ...</em></li>
<li>Eventually the Gitpod console will spawn a new tab with the Jupter UI running (<strong>check your pop-up blocker</strong> to let it through)</li>
<li>Insert the password <code>mlrules</code> to access the Jupyter UI</li>
</ul>
<details><summary>Steps for running locally (click to show)</summary>
<ul>
<li>Clone the repo, <code>cd</code> into it and launch <code>./init_tools.sh</code> (to get the required tools ready and <code>docker-compose</code> up and running).</li>
<li>Once that is finished, launch <code>./setup.sh</code> and follow the instructions, similarly as for Gitpod.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>You may need to use some custom IP instead of <code>localhost</code> if you<br />
use docker-for-mac, docker-for-windows or similar installation.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Known Issue</em>: in some cases executing the exercises may lead to memory issues, especially<br />
on weaker or non-Linux machines due to docker limitations on memory. If you have any<br />
issues with exercises after the first few, try to clean up and start again<br />
<code>docker-compose kill &amp;&amp; docker-compose down &amp;&amp; docker-compose up -d</code>.<br />
You may need to repeat steps of the notebook you were working on.</p>
</blockquote>
</details>
<details><summary>ü§¶ "I messed up and I need to re-initialize" (click to show)</summary>
<p>Don't worry, it happens. Re-initialization of the full repo goes as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>./init_tools.sh</code>: this downloads Astra DB client utilities and starts your <code>docker-compose</code> image(s). Make sure you have no running<br />
Docker images before re-launching this.</li>
<li><code>./setup.sh</code>: this allows you to re-create the secrets file. Launch again if you messed up with token info, bundle zipfile and so on. This, in turn, invokes the following ...</li>
<li><code>./initialize/initialize.sh</code>: table creation and bulk migration of needed datasets from files to database tables.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<h2><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="6-algorithms"> </a>6. Algorithms</h2>
<p>The main Jupyter web interface will list five numbered notebooks available.<br />
Each one illustrates a key algorithm in Machine Learning:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>K-Means</strong> Clustering</li>
<li><strong>Naive Bayes</strong> inference</li>
<li><strong>Random Forest</strong> classification</li>
<li><strong>FP-Growth</strong> recommendation</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative Filtering</strong> recommendation</li>
</ul>
<p>Click a notebook to open it in a new tab, then you can run all code cells<br />
sequentially by clicking on them and hitting <code>Ctrl + Enter</code>.<br />
Watch each code cell execute (its numbering will display <code>[*]</code> while running)<br />
and, when it finishes, move on to the next.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Note</em>: if you see errors such as empty or nonexisting tables, chances are<br />
you started the lab while the database was still being created or was in<br />
&quot;maintenance mode&quot;. To fix this, simply issue the command <code>./initialize/initialize.sh</code><br />
and wait one minute or so for it to complete.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="7-homework"> </a>7. Homework</h2>
<p><em>Now it's your turn!</em></p>
<p>Try to improve the accuracy (as computed on the test set) of the<br />
Random Forest classification model by tweaking its parameters.<br />
You will need to re-train the model and re-evaluate the accuracy at each try.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tip: look at the <a href="https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/reference/api/pyspark.ml.classification.RandomForestClassifier.html" target="_blank">documentation</a><br />
as a starting point, to see what options there are, pyspark.ml.classification.RandomForestClassifier).</p>
</blockquote>
<img src="https://github.com/datastaxdevs/workshop-introduction-to-machine-learning/raw/master/images/intro-ml-badge.png?raw=true" width="150" align="right" />
<p>You can proceed by selecting some parameters (such as <code>numTrees</code> or <code>maxDepth</code>),<br />
increase and decrease their value a bit, and compare the accuracy with the<br />
&quot;baseline&quot; result from the model you started with.<br />
Ideally you should change one parameter at a time,<br />
keeping all others the same as the &quot;baseline&quot;.<br />
Is the model accuracy more sensitive to <code>numTrees</code> or <code>maxDepth</code>?</p>
<p>If you really want to get serious, you could even automate this<br />
<em>hyperparameter search</em> in the code itself - possibly on a <em>grid</em> of choices<br />
for the parameters you want to test, such as:</p>
<pre><code>{numTrees in [5, 10, 20]} x {maxDepth in [2, 5, 10]} x { ... other parameters ... } ...
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Provide a screenshot of an improved choice of parameters, yielding an<br />
accuracy higher than the &quot;baseline&quot;</strong><br />
(Note: an improvement of at least 0.05 is possible).</p>
