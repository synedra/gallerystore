<h2><a class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" id="3-practice-questions"> </a>3. Practice questions</h2>
<p>As part of this workshop we have provided a set of 15 practice questions. These questions use the same style and form you can expect in the actual exams and will give you an idea of what to expect.</p>
<p>We highly suggest you run through these and test yourself. Each question will have a hidden answer. Try and answer them first before revealing the solution.</p>
